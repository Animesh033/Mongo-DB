Steps for Mocha Test -
1. npm init and follow the init steps
2. Run command to install mocha, mongoose and nodemon - npm install mocha mongoose nodemon
3. Create app and test dir inside MochaTest dir
4. create student.js file and define the schema for student
5. Create all the test file inside test dir and write the test code for Create, Read, Update and Delete Test
6. For simple console.log('xyz') we won't get error but when we use 'before' , 'describe' etc then we get the error msg: before not defined. It's because we are not using mocha for testing as of now so test with mocha we need to make changes in package.json file -

"scripts": {
    "test": "mocha"
  },

We need to set "mocha" in test scripts then

7. Open shell and move to MochaTest dir and Run command to execute the test - npm run test
